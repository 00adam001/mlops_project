# PHASE 3: Continuous Machine Learning (CML) & Deployment

## 1. Continuous Integration & Testing
- [x] **1.1 Unit Testing with pytest**
  - [x] Three test scripts created in `tests/test_sudoku_solver.py` for image preprocessing, dummy model prediction, and image loading.
  - [x] Tests are CI-safe (do not require model files) and executed successfully locally and in GitHub Actions.
  - [x] Documented with comments and structured test logic.

- [x] **1.2 GitHub Actions Workflows**
  - [x] `CI.yml` configured to run on push and pull requests to `main`.
  - [x] Runs linting with `ruff`, installs dependencies, and runs `pytest`.
  - [x] Includes Python 3.11 setup and error-safe linting/test flows.

- [x] **1.3 Pre-commit Hooks**
  - [x] `.pre-commit-config.yaml` present and used for linting and formatting checks.
  - [x] Ruff checks and unused import detection configured and documented.

## 2. Continuous Docker Building & CML
- [x] **2.1 Docker Image Automation**
  - [x] Dockerfiles (`predict_model.dockerfile`, `train_model.dockerfile`) created.
  - [x] GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes image to Artifact Registry.
  - [x] Deployment step commented out with clear explanation after Cloud Run success.

- [x] **2.2 Continuous Machine Learning (CML)**
  - [x] `cml.yml` GitHub Actions workflow included for evaluation.
  - [x] Metrics (`metrics.json`, `confusion_matrix.png`) generated locally and committed.
  - [x] `cml-publish` used to publish evaluation results in GitHub PR.
  - [x] GCP service account JSON stored in `GCP_SA_KEY` secret.
  - [x] DVC authentication and pull configured in CI pipeline using that secret.

## 3. Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- [x] **3.1 GCP Artifact Registry**
  - [x] Docker image tagged and pushed using GitHub Actions.
  - [x] Registry path: `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/dvc-drive-460320/sudoku-repo/sudoku-solver`.

- [ ] **3.2 Custom Training Job on GCP**
  - [ ] Not implemented.
  - [ ] All model training was performed locally.

- [x] **3.3 Deploying API with FastAPI & GCP Cloud Functions**
  - [x] FastAPI app defined in `predict.py` using Uvicorn.
  - [ ] Not deployed via Cloud Functions â€” deployed using Cloud Run.

- [x] **3.4 Dockerize & Deploy Model with GCP Cloud Run**
  - [x] Dockerfile serves model using FastAPI on port 8080.
  - [x] `gcloud run deploy` used in GitHub Actions.
  - [x] Deployment is commented out post-deployment to avoid CI re-deployment.

- [ ] **3.5 Interactive UI Deployment**
  - [ ] Not implemented.
  - [ ] No Streamlit or Gradio demo deployed.

## 4. Documentation & Repository Updates
- [x] **4.1 Comprehensive README**
  - [x] Setup, usage, CI/CD, and deployment steps documented.
  - [x] Includes Docker, FastAPI, DVC, and CML usage.
  - [x] Screenshots and confusion matrix included.

- [x] **4.2 Resource Cleanup Reminder**
  - [x] Comment added in GitHub Actions: Deployment is disabled post-Cloud Run setup.
  - [x] Reminder to shut down instances and avoid extra billing.

---

> **Checklist:** All CI/CD and CML integration is production-ready. Deployment is stable and well-documented. Evaluation artifacts are available and test coverage is ensured in CI.
